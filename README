What is this

        The idea behind this is to present the user with a very simple 
        interface for browsing .mp4 files which can be played by an HTML5 web 
        browser natively through the <video> tags.

        The backend (database) for this is a plain text file with 
        null-separated values.

        Thumbnails are pre-generated using a script.

        If you have a really large database of vidoes and fell that a database 
        is really required then please let me know or send a pull request as 
        I've not seen a situation where that volume of video data fits on my 
        NAS.

Ok I'm sold, how do I setup the web server

        Firstly you will need to set up your web server. The only requirement 
        is Perl/FCGI, to do this with Apache you might use something similar to 
        the following:

        <Location /www/fcgi>
                AddHandler fcgid-script .fcgi
                Options +ExecCGI
        </Location>

        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteRule ^/$ /www/fcgi/index.fcgi [R=301]

        RewriteRule ^/img/(.*) /www/img/$1   [QSA]

How to I make the thumbnail data

        1. If your source files are not in .mp4 format, convert them first, 
           using the script 'convert_mp4'

        find . -type f -name '*.mpeg' | convert_mp4

        2. Take an image from the middle of the file as the reference

        find . -type f -name '*.mp4' | middle_thumbnail

        3. Down size the images

        find . -type f -name '*.png' | thumbnail_maker

        The paths in the output need to be formed from the perspective of the 
        www root, so that when the images/video files are referenced they will 
        be retrievable from the user browser.

        ( cd /mnt/nas && find www/img/thumbnails -type f ) \
        | sh thumbnail_maker \
        > ../data
